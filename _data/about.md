When I was a small boy, I was endlessly fascinated by the mechanics of the world around me. My favorite tool was a screwdriver, always within arm’s reach, ready to dismantle any broken object in the house just to see how it worked. I would ask my mother for anything broken—an old clock, a remote, even a blender—so I could open it up, study it, and attempt to fix it or reassemble its parts into something new. That childhood instinct to explore, deconstruct, and rebuild laid the foundation for what would become a lifelong desire to "open people up and fix them."

As I grew older, I became increasingly intrigued by the human body’s complexity, particularly the circulatory system, which felt like the ultimate biological mechanism—always in motion, beautifully ordered, yet vulnerable to disruption. I initially imagined a future in cardiovascular surgery, but that vision shifted during medical school. There, I encountered a surgical gastroenterologist—a master of precision, calmness, and compassion. Observing his skillful operative techniques and his ability to transform lives through his interventions reshaped my perspective. I realized that my true calling lay in surgical gastroenterology and oncology, fields that demand not only anatomical expertise and technical finesse, but also the ability to confront cancer with courage, innovation, and purpose.

Throughout medical school, I was relentless in my pursuit of surgical exposure. I immersed myself in the operating room, and sought mentorship wherever possible. I discovered that surgery is not only an intellectual discipline—it is a deeply human one. Each case is a story, a responsibility, and a chance to impact a life meaningfully.

Yet, I understood early that clinical skill alone would not be enough. In a rapidly evolving surgical landscape, meaningful progress lies at the intersection of clinical care, research, and innovation. This insight led me to develop a parallel identity as a researcher. To date, I have published multiple papers, led over more than 60 ongoing projects, and participated in randomized controlled trials. My work has spanned robotic surgery, obesity and metabolic surgery, surgical oncology, and artificial intelligence in surgical planning. I have gained proficiency in research methodology, systematic review design, biostatistics, IRB navigation, and scientific writing, and have mentored others in developing these same skills.

I am fortunate to be mentored by international leaders like Prof. Rodolfo J. Oviedo, Prof. Luigi Marano, Prof. Adel Abou-Mrad under whose guidance I have contributed to high-impact projects on robotic surgery, gastrectomy, obesity, HPB surgery, oncology, systematic reviews, and the Autonomous Robotic Surgery Initiative. These collaborations have shown me the power of global teamwork—across countries, time zones, and clinical systems—in shaping the future of surgery.

One of the most significant aspects of my professional development has been my association with TROGSS—The Robotic Global Surgical Society. As Chair of the Medical Student Committee and Co-Director of Robotic Time Zone, I’ve had the opportunity to work at the core of TROGSS’s academic mission. I’ve helped structure the Robotic Time Zone taskforce into three functional verticals: the Content Team, the Newsletter Team, and the Podcast Team—each with specific roles and an internal approval pipeline to ensure quality and consistency. I’ve led and contributed to abstract and surgical video submissions for ICS 2025, represented TROGSS at the major international conferences and supported the onboarding of medical students and faculty from across the globe. I also had the privilege of representing TROGSS at the Rotary Club in Nacogdoches, Texas, where I presented the mission and vision of the society to an audience that included key industry leaders from across the state. During this engagement, I was able to initiate discussions and explore potential avenues for future financial support for upcoming TROGSS fellows.

In alignment with TROGSS’s mission, I have two independent initiatives: Magister Chirurgiae and the Global Surgical Research Program. Magister Chirurgiae is an advanced academic series I founded to deliver high-level surgical education through high-yield, case-based lectures by global experts. Its goal is to bring clarity to complex surgical decision-making, particularly in robotic and gastrointestinal surgery. The Global Surgical Research Program, on the other hand, is a structured mentorship and research capacity-building initiative designed to train students and early-career professionals in systematic reviews, clinical research methodology, and academic writing. These programs were born out of my vision to make high-quality surgical education and research training globally accessible and equitable. I chose to collaborate with TROGSS on these initiatives because of our aligned missions—to foster excellence, mentorship, and global opportunity in robotic and minimally invasive surgery.

In addition to founding these programs, I have the opportunity to lead the “On Behalf of TROGSS Research Consortium” and coordinated multiple collaborative review projects. I also led the creation of the TROGSS Membership Form to gather detailed information about member interests, which later laid the groundwork for elective and observership program planning. I’ve advocated for TROGSS at every level—academically, institutionally, and publicly—ensuring that the society continues to grow as a hub of academic excellence and surgical collaboration.

Receiving the TROGSS Traveling Scholar Award would be both an honor and a responsibility. I believe I am a strong candidate not only because of my academic credentials and contributions but because I have actively built with and for TROGSS. From organizing major initiatives, leading research collaborations, founding academic platforms, and expanding the society’s global reach, I have shown a consistent and proactive commitment to its mission. This award would provide me with an opportunity to take that commitment further—to represent TROGSS on a global platform, to engage with surgical mentors and innovators from around the world, and to bring back valuable insights, connections, and experiences that would benefit the entire TROGSS community.

As a Traveling Scholar, I would aim to strengthen institutional collaborations, expand observership and elective opportunities for TROGSS members, showcase our academic work at international meetings, and enhance our collective learning through global exposure. I also view this award as a way to demonstrate the potential of medical students and early-career surgeons to take initiative, lead academic innovation, and meaningfully contribute to global surgery.

From a curious child with a screwdriver to a surgeon-in-training working at the crossroads of surgery, research, and education, my journey has always been shaped by curiosity, discipline, and an unshakable commitment to growth. I am grateful for how far I have come, and I am even more excited for the road ahead. With the support of the TROGSS Traveling Scholar Award, I hope to not only continue learning at the highest level but also give back in even greater measure to the society and community that have shaped my professional path.

Thank you for considering my nomination.
